### Miroculus challenge

Please run yarn & yarn dev to init the application.

Tasks:
● Describe how do you measure distance

-In this case I could not finish this point with the time given.
I thought the problem like the Battleship game (naval battle). The algorithm has to calculate wich of the points of the array meets the requirement of distance D given, and save them into clusters.
Maybe the algorithm has to parse every coordenate of the array in X and Y values, and compare one to one with the rest of the coordenates. If X + / - the distance D, and Y + / - the distance D, it should be able to calculate if the pair of coordenates is a cluster or not of each pair of coordenates of the array.
Then if the condition is met, the coordenates of the cluster should be saved in a new array, and then push the result into a final array that saves the coordenates and the clusters re-ordered.

As I couldn't finish the algorithm, many of the points in the assignment are not solved.

The algorithm should be put inside a function, receive the distance for the client, and return the new array of the solution through the api.
